## Key Features


- **Comprehensive Question Bank**
40 meticulously curated multiple-choice questions covering core HTML concepts, from basic tags and structure to advanced attributes and semantics. Supports variable option counts (2 or 4 choices) for flexible quiz design.


- **State Persistence**
Utilizes local storage to save progress, including answered questions, selections, scores, and elapsed time—ensuring seamless resumption even after browser closure or refresh.


- **Intuitive Navigation & UI**
Single-question view with previous/next buttons, a dynamic progress bar, real-time timer, and score tracking. Beginner-oriented styling with encouraging feedback like _"Great job – you're learning fast!"_ to build confidence.


- **Summary & Review Mode**
Detailed post-quiz summary with total time, scores, and per-question breakdowns (correct/wrong/unanswered), including your answers and correct solutions for self-reflection.


- **Modular Architecture**
Questions are isolated in `Script/questions.js` for easy customization or expansion. Leveraging ES6 modules ensures maintainability and scalability.


- **Responsive & Accessible Design**
Fully responsive layout with soft gradients, rounded aesthetics, and high-contrast elements for an inclusive experience across devices.


- **Advanced Quiz Mechanics**
Inspired by Quizlet and Kahoot, includes retry options per question, visual feedback animations, and a "Finish Quiz" button unlocked only after full engagement.
